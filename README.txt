This plugin help to add custom status(draft) to selected taxonomies.

== Description ==

By utilizing this plugin, there is no need to permanently delete a term when it is no longer required. Instead of deleting it entirely, you can simply move it to the draft status, effectively removing it from the frontend. This approach ensures that the term is preserved in the backend for future reference or reactivation if needed, while seamlessly eliminating its visibility on the frontend.
